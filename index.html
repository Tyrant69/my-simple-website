            The "God of War" series is known not only for its intense action and combat sequences but also for its compelling narrative and character development. In the 2018 installment of the series, also titled "God of War," Kratos embarks on a journey with his son, Atreus, in the realm of Norse mythology. This game marks a significant departure from the previous installments, introducing a more mature and reflective Kratos, grappling with the consequences of his past actions.</p>
